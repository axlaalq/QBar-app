# QBar-app
Event and employee management app. 

I am currently developing an app using Kivy and KivyMD 2.0.1.dev0 to manage employee, event, and client information for two businesses: Vega (a waiter's business) and QBar (a cocktail bar). The app will facilitate the management of data provided by the companies, enabling users to add and update information efficiently. Additionally, the app will integrate with Supabase for cloud storage and will connect to the database using PostgreSQL and Python for data management.

A key feature of the app is an algorithm that helps plan events by considering the distance between waiters and the venue. This will optimize logistics by ensuring that the nearest employees are assigned to each event. The app will also provide data visualization tools to predict future event demand and graph financial data, offering valuable insights for better decision-making.

Once the code is completed, I will build the app using Buildozer and Docker to create a Linux-based container image for seamless deployment.
